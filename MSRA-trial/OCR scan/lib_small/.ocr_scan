For example, will radiation from electromc equipment destroy the environment? (Sho)uld medical scientists change gene structures to prevent genetic disease or to create "more perfect" human beings? While people are arguing about these and others, continues to influence our everyday lives—the home, health and education, Some people carry on active social lives with computers —their own or the ones in public places like cdtees,tloncmiale and so on. Communicating with others in chat rooms, computer users can get to know people they might never meet in traditional ways. With live online video connections, two people with cameras in their computers can see and talk to each other from separate places. With modern telephone technology, most people stopped writing letters—especially personal letters and notes. But now, writing to communicate has returned in electronic form, or e-mail, which is a way of sending messages from one computer to another. For some computer users, the wish to communicate intelligently or creatively with others makes them want to write better. Computer technology has also made it possible to run a house electronically. From turning lights on and off to starting the coffee and cooking the hot meal, computers are taking care Of people at home. Many modern machines have computer that their to program them. For instance, "instruct" a microwave oven how to cook a dish. Most entertainment equipment operates with computer technology too. Computers can even start cars automatically so that on cold winter mornings you can get into a warmed-up vehicle and drive off. Although much of the technology in our everyday lives has good effects, there are some uses that raise questions. For example, are interactive media ( i.e., a combination of television, telephone, and computer) going to control minds, cause people to forget about family life and personal relationships? What effects will the genetic engineering of food have on people's health?

The vvritcr wrote the passage to tell us A. to enjoy what we have now B. to value now and not to lose chances C. to protect the beautiful flowers we see D. to love those who are your close relatives (D) Play is the basic business of childhood, and in recent years research has shown the great importance of play in the development ora human being. From earliest infancy ( , every child needs opportunity and right materials for play, and the main tools of play are toys. The main function of toys is to suggest, encourage and play. To succeed in this, they be good toys, which children will play with often, and will corne back again and again. Therefore, it is important to choose suitable toys for different stages of a child's developnent. In recent years, research on baby development has shown that the standard a child is likely to reach, within the range of his inherited ) abilities, is largely determined in the first three years of his life. So a baby's ability to benefit from the right play materials should not be underestimated. A baby who is encouraged, talked to and shown things and played with, has the best chance of growing up successfully. In the next stage, from three to five years old, curiosity knows no bounds. Every type Of suitable toys should be made available to the child, for trying out, experimenting and learning, for discovering his own particular ability: Bricks and jigsaws ( -1-351k) and construction toys; painting, scribbling and making things; sand and water play; toys for imaginative and pretending play—the first social games for learning to play and get on with others. But at the third stage of play development—from five to seven or eight years old— the child is at school. But for a few more years play is still the best way of learning, at home or at school. It is easier to see which type of toys the child most enjoys. Until the age of seven or eight, play and work mean much the same to a child. But once reading has been mastered, then books become the main source of learning. Toys are still interesting and valuable, which lead up to new hobbies, but their si ificance has changed to a child of nine or ten years old, toys and games mean, as to adults, relaxa_ • and fun. 57. What does the writer t to tell us in the first paragraph? 4. Children should c ose toys by themselves. B. Children like aying, but they don't need any toys. C. Childre ould be given different toys as they grow up. D. Chil en should be given the same toys as they grow up. 5 .

A. quickly (3 c Chinese are very generous when it comes to educating their children. Not caring about the money, parents often send their children to the best schools or even abroad to England, the United States or Australia. They also want their children to take extra-course ( $1ii9f'$JiÆ*ä ) activities where they will either learn music or dance. or other classes that will give them a head start in life. The Chinese believe that the more expensive an education is, the better it is. So parents will spend an unreasonable amount of money on education. Even poor couples will buy a computer for their son or daughter. However, what most parents fail to see is that thebest early education they can give their children is usually very cheap. Parents can see that their children's skills are different, maybe skilled in some areas while poor in others. What most parents fail to realize though. is that today's children are in need of self-respect and self-confidence. The problem is that parents are only educating their children on how to take tests and how to study well, but parents are not teaching them the most important skills they need to be confident, happy and clever. Parents can achieve this by teaching practical skills like cooking, sewing and doing other housework. Teaching a child to cook will improve many of the skills that he will need later in life. Cooking requires patience and time. It is an enjoyable but difficult experience. A good cook always tries to improve his cooking, so he will learn to work hard and gradually finish his job successfully. His result, a well-cooked dinner, will give him much satisfaction and a lot of self-confidence. Some old machines, such as a broken radio or TV set that you give your child to play with will make him curious (ÜfGÉ6J) and have interest. He will spend hours looking at them, trying to fix them; your child might become an engineer vshen he grows up. These activities are not only teaching a child to read a book, but rather to think, to use his mind. And that is more important. 50. Most Chinese parents don't realize A. how much the best education is worth B. when children should be educated C. what children really need in later life D. why school tests don't satisfy children 51.

(C) If English means endless new words, difficult gramrnar and sometimes strange pronunciation, you are wrong. Haven•t you noticed that you have becolne cleverer since you started to learn a language? According to a new study by a British university, learning a second language can lead to aa increase in your brain power. Researchers found that learning other languages changes gr_gy matter. It is similar to the way that exercise builds muscles (hJtF±l) , A team led by Dr. Andrea Mechelli, from University College London, took a group of Britons who only spoke English. They were compared with a group of "early bilinguals" who had learnt a second language before the age of five, as well as a number of later learners. Scans (13%) showed that grey matter density (S' R) in the brain was greater in bilinguals than in people without a second language. But the longer a person waited before mastering a new language, the smaller the difference: "Our findings suggest that the structure of the brain is changed by the experience of leaming a second language," said the scientists. It means that the change itself increase the ability to leam. Professor Dylan Vauhan Jones of the University of Wales has researched the link betss:een he bilingualism and math skills. "Having two languages gives you two windows on the world nd makes the brain more flexible (A , " he said. "You are going beyond language and have 2

(D) Children can spend hours a day looking at computer screens and other digital devices Some eye doctors say this leads to an increase in "computer vision syndrome $ifrfi)." Nathan Bonilla-Warford is an optometrist in Tampa, Florida. He has seen an increase in problems in children. "A lot more children come into the office either because their parents have noticed that they have headaches or red or watery eyes or discomfort, or because their nearsightedness appears to be increasing and they're worried," he says. Dr. Bonilla-Warford says part of the problem is that children may be more likely to pay no attention to early warning signs than adults. "Even if their eyes start to feel uncomfortable or they start to get a headache, they're less likely to tell their parents, because they don't want to have the game or the computer or whatever taken away," he explains. He says another part of the problem is that people blink ( EIZHR) less often when they use digital devices. He says, "A person who uses an electronic device blinks about one third as much as we normally do in everyday life. And so that can result in the front part of the eye drying and not staying protected like normal." Eye doctors offer suggestions like following which is known as the 20/20/20 rule. That means every twenty minutes look away twenty feet or more for at least twenty seconds from whatever device you're using. Other suggestions include putting more distance between you and the device and using good lighting. Of course, another way is to spend less time looking at screens. Many experts say children should spend no more than two hours a day using digital devices—with no screen time for children under two. But not all eye doct have noticed an increase in problems in children. Dr. David Hunter, from Children's Hospital B ton, has not seen an increase in his practice. "While it is possible to develop fatigue looking at s ens for a long period of time, there's certainly no proof that it actually causes any damage ( ffJÜ•) the eyes." he says. ) 57. WW of the following is true according to the passage? . Dr. nilla-Warford thinks using computers causes nearsightedness. B. ple keep their eyes protected against drying by blinking normally. C. Children under two can watch TV for less than two hours a day. D. Dr. David Hunter says headache causes an increase in eye problems. 3

Before you are allowed to have a full license, you have to take a driving test, You can take a test in your own car, but it has to be fit for the road. In the test you have to drive round for about half an hour and then answer a few questions. If you don't pass the test, you arc allowed to take it again a few weeks later if you want to.
